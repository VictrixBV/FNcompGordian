# Comparison FN and FN2

**A comparison of the differences and similarities of [FN](https://github.com/Fonta1n3/FullyNoded) and [FN2](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/FullyNoded-2)**

# Similarities

Both complement each other. The holy grail of bitcoin secure storage is multisig and not having to rely on one app/device/codebase/etc, both are capable of multisig and **can be independent signers for the same multisig wallet**.
