# Comparison FN and Gordian Wallet

**A comparison of the differences and similarities of [Fully Noded](https://github.com/Fonta1n3/FullyNoded)**, **[Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS)** formerly known as FN2, **[Wasabi](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi)** and **[Samourai](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet)**.

[@Fonta1n3](https://github.com/Fonta1n3), the creator of both FN and Gordian Wallet, said it pretty straightforward when the question *Whatâ€™s the difference between version FN1 and FN2?* was raised the first time in 2020: <br/>

**"Gordian is a wallet, Fully Noded is a remote control for your node"**

We'll go into much more detail of the comparison by introducing other wallets to compare with: Samourai and Wasabi.

# Similarities

All wallets complement each other in some ways. The holy grail of bitcoin secure storage is multisig and not having to rely on one app/device/codebase/etc, the best of breed wallets, like the ones we benchmark, are capable of multisig and **can be independent signers for the same multisig wallet**.

## Hardware Wallet Interface
Our comparison here keeps the discussion lean about Hardware Wallets. An extensive list can be found on github [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI)

## The in-between role of Electrum Personal Server
"Introducing Electrum Personal Server; an implementation of the Electrum server protocol which fulfills the specific need of using the Electrum UI with full node verification and privacy, but without the heavyweight server backend, for a single user. It allows the user to benefit from all of Bitcoin Core's resource-saving features like pruning, blocksonly and disabled txindex. All of Electrum's feature-richness like hardware wallet integration, multisignature wallets, offline signing, mnemonic recovery phrases and so on can still be used, but backed by the user's own full node."
