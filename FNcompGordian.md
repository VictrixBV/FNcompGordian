# Comparison FN and Gordian Wallet

**A comparison of the differences and similarities of [Fully Noded](https://github.com/Fonta1n3/FullyNoded) and [Gordian Wallet](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS)**, formerly known as FN2

[@Fonta1n3](https://github.com/Fonta1n3), the creator of both FN and Gordian Wallet, said it pretty straightforward when the question *Whatâ€™s the difference between version FN1 and FN2?* was raised the first time in 2020: <br/>

**"Gordian is a wallet, Fully Noded is a remote control for your node"**

We'll go into much more detail of the comparison by introducing other wallets to compare with: <TBW>

# Similarities

Both complement each other. The holy grail of bitcoin secure storage is multisig and not having to rely on one app/device/codebase/etc, both are capable of multisig and **can be independent signers for the same multisig wallet**.
