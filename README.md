# FNcompFN2
Comparison of Fully Noded and FN2 [here](./FNcompFN2.md)

## What is this?
This mini project offers **a comparison of the differences and similarities of [FN](https://github.com/Fonta1n3/FullyNoded) and [FN2](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/FullyNoded-2)**, as far as objectives, features & functionality are concerned.

## Why relevant?
Although the names are very similar, FN and FN2, their objectives are different. FN2 will get another name soon. Anyway, to have a structured overview of the differences and similarities on various topics is far from a *"unnecessary luxury"*.
