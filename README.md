# FNcompGordian
Comparison of Fully Noded (FN) and Gordian Wallet, formerly known as 'FN2' [here](./FNcompGordian.md)

## What is this?
This mini project offers **a comparison of the differences and similarities of [Fully Noded](https://github.com/Fonta1n3/FullyNoded) [Gordian Wallet (fka FN2)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS)**, **[Wasabi](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi)** and **[Samourai](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet)** as far as these categories of features are concerned: <br/>
 - General
 - Objectives
 - Wallet types
 - Node connections
 - Hardware wallet integration
 - Technical stuff

## Why relevant?
FN was first. Then BlockchainCommons and @Fonta1n3 invented a spin-off, which is now called Gordian Wallet.<br/>
And Samourai Wallet and Wasabi Wallet are two other competing wallets to benchmark against.

## Naming
The names used to be very similar, FN and FN2, but their objectives were always different, which gratefully led to a divergent naming, July 2020: *Fully Noded* versus *Gordian Wallet* <br/>
The creator of FullyNoded, @Fonta1n3, develops and maintains both iOS apps. Gordian Wallet and Fully Noded.

## Objective?
This analysis provides an overview of the most advanced wallets, their funcionality, strengths and weaknesses.
