# FNcompGordian
Comparison of Fully Noded (FN) and Gordian Wallet, formerly known as 'FN2' [here](./FNcompGordian.md)

## What is this?
This mini project offers **a comparison of the differences and similarities of [FN](https://github.com/Fonta1n3/FullyNoded) and [FN2](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianWallet-iOS)**, as far as objectives, features & functionality are concerned.

## Why relevant?
FN was first. Then BlockchainCommons and @Fonta1n3 invented a spin-off, which is now called Gordian Wallet.<br/>
The names used to be very similar, FN and FN2, but their objectives were always different, which gratefully led to a divergent naming, July 2020: *Fully Noded* versus *Gordian Wallet* <br/>
The creator of FullyNoded, @Fonta1n3, develops and maintains both iOS apps. Gordian Wallet and Fully Noded.

## Objective?
This analysis provides an overview of the most advanced wallets, their funcionality, strengths and weaknesses.
